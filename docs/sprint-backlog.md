# Product backlog
 - Get webcam interaction with browser working
   - Complexity: **low**
   - Time requirement: **low**
   - This is relatively straightforward with modern web technology
 - Get p2p video chat working over WebRTC
    - Complexity: **high**. This is the most complex part of the application
    - Time requirement: **high**.
    - Ben Haney is familiar with this technology, so he should spearhead the development effort on it
 - Manage multiple rooms
   - Complexity: **medium**.
   - Time requirement: **medium**.
   - If we write the code for the single p2p video chat modular enough, this should be straightforward to implement. If we don't, then this could take awhile
