# Product backlog
 - Get webcam interaction with browser working
   - Complexity: **low**
   - Time requirement: **low**
   - This is relatively straightforward with modern web technology
 - Get p2p video chat working over WebRTC
    - Complexity: **high**. This is the most complex part of the application
    - Time requirement: **high**.
    - Ben Haney is familiar with this technology, so he should spearhead the development effort on it
 - Manage multiple rooms
   - Complexity: **medium**.
   - Time requirement: **medium**.
   - If we write the code for the single p2p video chat modular enough, this should be straightforward to implement. If we don't, then this could take awhile
 - Group chats
   - Complexity: **high**.
   - Time requirement: **medium**.
   - This shouldn't require massive code changes if we write the code well the first time (read: if we write it modular enough). However, it has high complexity because it introduces new bug-vectors and edge cases that need to be tested/checked.
 - Text chat
   - Complexity: **low**.
   - Time requirement: **medium**.
   - This isn't too difficult to add, but will take some time to add to the application
 - Accounts
   - Complexity: **medium**.
   - Time requirement: **medium**.
   - This will require adding a database backend to store account credentials
- Recorded sessions
   - Complexity: **high**.
   - Time requirement: **high**.
   - This will require serious planning about how to store and retrieve (potentially large) video files on/from the server
